Proof-of-concept web based tools integrated within WebGLStudio which essentially consists of a renderer on the web which can achieve photorealistic results and match real lighting conditions. Presenting a set of web tools to extract the environmental light from HDR images as light probes, to store this information and use it to match the rendered scene with the setting and light complexity of a realistic environment using PBR rendering techniques.
